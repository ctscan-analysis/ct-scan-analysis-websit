## Lund-Mackay Scoring System

The Lund-Mackay score is a CT-based scoring system for chronic rhinosinusitis. It's popular due to its simplicity and high inter and intra-observer reliability.

### Scoring Method:
When reading a CT scan of the paranasal sinuses and ostiomeatal complex, the reader assigns each sinus a score of:
- No abnormality: 0 points
- Partial opacification: 1 point
- Complete opacification: 2 points

The ostiomeatal complex is scored differently:
- Not obstructed: 0 points
- Obstructed: 2 points

The sinuses are grouped into:
- Frontal sinus
- Anterior ethmoidal cells
- Posterior ethmoidal cells
- Maxillary sinus
- Sphenoid sinus
- Ostiomeatal complex

Each side is graded separately. A combined score of up to 24 is possible. An aplastic (absent) frontal sinus receives a score of 0.

### Modified Lund-Mackay (Zinreich) Score:
For a more accurate representation of disease burden, modifications were proposed:
- 0%: 0 points
- <25%: 1 point
- 26-50%: 2 points
- 51-75%: 3 points
- 76-99%: 4 points
- 100%: 5 points

The ostiomeatal complex is scored:
- 0 (normal)
- 1 (partially obstructed)
- 2 (completely obstructed)

Maximum total score: 54

## Haller Cells

Haller cells, also known as infraorbital ethmoidal air cells, are ethmoid air cells located lateral to the maxillo-ethmoidal suture along the inferomedial orbital floor.

### Epidemiology:
They are present in ~20% (range 2-45%) of patients, depending on their exact definition.

### Clinical Significance:
In most instances, they are asymptomatic and generally not thought to be associated with increased rates of sinusitis. However, they may become clinically significant in several situations:
- They can become infected, with the potential for extension into the orbit
- They may narrow the ipsilateral ostiomeatal complex (OMC) if large, thereby predisposing the ipsilateral maxillary antrum to obstruction
- They may lead to inadvertent entry into the orbit if unrecognized during endoscopic surgery

## Kuros Classification
Based on limited search results, this appears to be a classification system for sinusitis, but detailed information was not readily available. Further research is needed to implement this classification system accurately.

## Harshala Classification
Based on limited search results, this appears to be a classification system for sinusitis, but detailed information was not readily available. Further research is needed to implement this classification system accurately.

## Next Steps for Research
1. Conduct more specific searches for Kuros and Harshala classification systems
2. Research image processing techniques for CT scan analysis
3. Investigate machine learning approaches for automated detection and classification
4. Research visualization techniques for highlighting detected features on CT images
